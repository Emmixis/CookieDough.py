# How do I contact the GBJ staff?
Head to <#1172337920431104053>, and click `Open a ticket!`. This will put you in a channel with staff only, where you can express your concerns.
## Why can't I just send a PM to staff members?
Staff members are users of the server, first and foremost. We don't want to be a looming authority over the masses, we want to enjoy the server in the same way you do. This allows us to keep our PMs clear of formalities, and fosters friendships, rather than a power dynamic. 
## What if I have a complaint against another staff member?
If you need to submit a formal complaint against another moderator, we still urge you to use the ticket system. Each ticket has a robust logging system, allowing everyone to see the transcript of a ticket's message history. We use this to keep each staff member accountable. 
If you believe it's urgent, and the server is in danger, you may message any of the available babysitters individually. Abusing this may result in a warning.

## ____Why Are There Bots Talking?____
<@!466378653216014359> is a bot designed for plural systems that use Discord. It allows you to register systems, \
maintain system information, set up alters, set up message proxying, log headmate switching, and more.
Basically, the bot detects messages from an account and then is able to replace that message under a "proxy" \
account using webhooks. This is useful for multiple people sharing one body (systems), people who wish to \
roleplay as different characters without having several accounts, or anyone else who may want to post messages as a \
different person from one account. TL;DR, they're not bots, but regular chatters proxying their messages through \
a bot. You can react to a PK proxied message with ‚ùì to get info about the account that posted it, and üîî to ping the \
account.

You can learn more about the bot on [PluralKit's website](<https://pluralkit.me/>) \
or by using `pk;help in <#395837746083528704>`
You can learn more about plurality on [MoreThanOne.info](<https://morethanone.info/>)''')

When the Diaper Training role is pinged, all users must prove they're wearing a diaper with a picture. \

## üìú Rules:
* Once pinged, you have 3 hours to prove you're padded. After you've provided proof, you're immune for 8 hours. \
However, we encourage you to continue participating.
* You can provide preemptive proof if you know you'll be unable to check discord for over 3 hours. \
When you return, you must also provide another picture.
 * You must provide a detailed explanation as to why. Mundane reasons won't be accepted.
* If asleep, you'll be required to show proof upon waking up.
## <:MeruPolice:935948597063716874> Punishment for Failure:
Failing to respect the rules will result in a 1,000üç™ penalty OR losing the role. 
To pay the fee, type `!pay <@641788291225747487> 1000` (or just pay <@!641788291225747487> 1000üç™). 
If you would rather not pay, ping `@girl.kisser` or `@Glasswalker` to remove the role.
**If you're caught lying or reusing an old photo, you will be banned from the server for 14 days.**

## Rule 2: No Roleplay (or baby-talk)
We understand this is a very divisive rule which many don't understand. In short, we haven't curated GBJ to be a \
space for roleplay, and we feel it often comes into conflict with our desire to make the server a casual hang-out spot \
to have conversation in. There is a community owned opt-in channel <#855947209560162355> where you're free to roleplay \
and use baby-talk to your heart's content. You can opt-in at <#858253598944526337>. We also allow roleplay in \
<#1006312425487867944> threads which explicitly allow it in the OP.
\
## How does GBJ define roleplay (and baby-talk)?
We define **roleplay** in a number of ways. One of which includes any type of "action message". Examples include: \
_hugs_, [hugs], hugs you, etc.
Of course, roleplay can also involve any type of behavior which is fictional in nature and meant to act out a fantasy. \
one could roleplay a conversation with fictional circumstances. For example, talking as if you're in a nursery and are \
getting changed by the person you're talking to (or vice versa.)
Just because it isn't listed as an example doesn't mean we may not consider it roleplay. We'll use our best judgement \
when we're determining if a message is RP or not. However, emoji in almost all contexts are fine. Maybe use those as a\
substitute!
**Baby-talk** is a bit more complicated, but it's sort of a "know it when you see it" situation. Purposefully incorrect \
grammar, spelling, etc.
\
## How can I express myself?
As stated earlier, we have a range of emoji that you can use to express yourself, many of which are available without \
Nitro. If there's an emote we're missing, you can use `.economy` to learn how to buy it and add it to the server. You \
can also use `.stamps` to get a list of stamps provided by me, <@!641788291225747487>! They're a bit like stickers, but \
completely free. Albeit they only work in servers I'm a part of.
